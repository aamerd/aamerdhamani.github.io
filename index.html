<p class="h">About 'D'</p>
<p>Aamer Dhamani -- nicknamed 'D' because not many people can pronounce his last name properly the first three dozen times -- is a closet-writer.</p>
<p>D was born in Abu Dhabi, UAE, and moved to Pakistan a couple of weeks before the Gulf War broke out. He started freelancing a decade later. And after enjoying being his own boss for about a decade -- so he could have all the time he would need to write his bestseller, but procrastination got the better of him -- he became a part of the Pakistani print media:</p>
<p>February 2009 to February 2015<br>Subeditor<br>Daily Times / Pakistan Today / The News International</p>
<p>March 2015 to May 2016<br>Editorial Consultant / Subeditor<br>The Express Tribune</p>
<p>November 2016 to date<br>Senior Subeditor<br>The News International</p>
<p>On this website you'll find a handful of articles that D has written. They include a review, a comment and some profiles.</p>
<p>Happy reading -- if you're not going to procrastinate, that is.</p>
