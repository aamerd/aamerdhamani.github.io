<p class="h">About ‘D’</p>
<p>Aamer Dhamani – nicknamed ‘D’ because not many people can pronounce his last name properly the first three dozen times – is a closet-writer. Currently on a career break, he is procrastinating and indulging in reveries of becoming a fulltime novelist.</p>
<p>D was born in Abu Dhabi, UAE, and moved to Pakistan a couple of weeks before the Gulf War broke out. He started freelancing a decade later. And after enjoying being his own boss for about a decade – so he could have all the time he would need to write his bestseller, but procrastination got the better of him – he became a part of the Pakistani print media in 2009.</p>
<p>Until May 2016, he was an editorial consultant / subeditor for The Express Tribune’s national desk. He has also worked as a subeditor for The News International (TNI), Pakistan Today (PT) and Daily Times.</p>
<p>On this website you’ll find a handful of articles that D has written for PT and TNI. They include a review, a comment and some profiles.</p>
<p>Happy reading – if you’re not going to procrastinate, that is.</p>
