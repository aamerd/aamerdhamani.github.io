<h1>Published stories</h1>
<h2>A discreet exit of a discreet man</h2>
<p>April 18, 2021: Whenever you hear about someone taking to their bed or being hospitalised, one of the ways you fear it might end is, quite naturally, in death. And however many deaths may have occurred during your life, you never get used to it — as you’re most brutally reminded every time it happens again. <a href="https://thenews.com.pk/print/821851" target="_blank">Read more...</a></p>
<h2>‘Everything in landscape painting must exude a sense of natural balance’</h2>
<p>October 25, 2020: If society hadn’t rejected him at every point, Pakistan would’ve lost a great artist to obscurity and not even known about its huge loss. “I probably would’ve lived and died in anonymity,” Zulfiqar Ali Zulfi told me in an interview. <a href="https://thenews.com.pk/print/734291" target="_blank">Read more...</a></p>
<h2>Whatever will be, will be</h2>
<p>June 28, 2020: I first met Anil Datta sahib in the winter of 2012 after I joined The News. It didn’t take much to understand that he was someone who preferred to live within his thoughts more than in the world around him. <a href="https://thenews.com.pk/print/678817" target="_blank">Read more...</a></p>
<h2>Lockdown lessons for restless Karachi from around the globe</h2>
<p>April 12, 2020: The place where a person lives shapes them as much as they shape it. Karachi is a vibrant metropolis, and its people are no less lively. Whatever happens to the city happens to us, and vice versa. <a href="https://thenews.com.pk/print/643126" target="_blank">Read more...</a></p>
<h2>Don’t let the COVID-19 nightmare debilitate you!</h2>
<p>April 5, 2020: A bead of sweat appears at her temple and slowly slides down the side of her face. Her hands clutch a tissue in her lap. Her long fingernails pierce through it as her grip tightens further. <a href="https://thenews.com.pk/print/639520" target="_blank">Read more...</a></p>
<h2>From hygiene habits to family dynamics, COVID-19 is changing Karachi’s people</h2>
<p>March 23, 2020: Sonia Fakira of Naya Golimar goes through the checklist of all the precautionary measures with her ailing mother every morning before leaving the house. This has been her routine ever since COVID-19 hit Karachi and changed everything for everyone. <a href="https://thenews.com.pk/print/633064" target="_blank">Read more...</a></p>
<h2>State of Garden East paints a terrible picture of neglect and decay</h2>
<p>October 7, 2019: Standing at the gate of his apartment block, 30-something Sadiq* stares longingly at the motorcyclist sent by a ride-hailing service waiting for him on the opposite side of the street. Keeping to the farthest edge of the road, the driver has already brought his two-wheeler this far, but he seems unwilling to cross over to Sadiq’s side. <a href="https://thenews.com.pk/print/537580" target="_blank">Read more...</a></p>
<h2>Controversial ballot count follows a day of calm voting in Karachi</h2>
<p>July 26, 2018: As Wednesday [July 25, 2018] ended with peaceful voting across Karachi, claims by different political parties raised questions about transparency in the process of counting ballot papers at different polling stations of the city. <a href="https://thenews.com.pk/print/346148" target="_blank">Read more...</a></p>
<h2>As all bets are off in NA-245, can MQM still pull a hat-trick?</h2>
<p>July 23, 2018: On the delimitation map, Karachi’s NA-245 (East-IV) is highlighted in chartreuse, contrary to its real picture that fancies red, black, white and green since Partition. And if Karachi is the melting pot of Pakistani society, this National Assembly constituency is possibly a glimpse of it. <a href="https://thenews.com.pk/print/344990" target="_blank">Read more...</a></p>
<h2>Finest art can be created in borderline solitude</h2>
<p>August 26, 2013: The finest art can be created when you are one with yourself, in borderline solitude, Sana Arjumand told me in an interview. <a href="https://thenews.com.pk/archive/print/450850" target="_blank">Read more...</a></p>
<h2>Camel piss drinker v/s Jalebi Mullah</h2>
<p>February 27, 2012: My first reaction to reading about the recent protest against the LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender) people in Pakistan yet again was: What the duck! And then I heard a quack and thought: That’s a really slow bleeper. But that’s not what this article is about. <a href="https://archive.pakistantoday.com.pk/2012/02/27/camel-piss-drinker-vs-jalebi-mullah" target="_blank">Read more...</a></p>
<h2>At war with this thing called reality</h2>
<p>February 20, 2012: Art, says the artist Nadia Hussain, makes the world more beautiful and bearable – and somehow more significant. During an interview, Nadia told me that art is also what makes humanity more civilised. “It represents the need to express thoughts and feelings so that they last. And in some ways, art records history. It gives us a visual representation of the culture of a particular time and space,” she said. <a href="https://archive.pakistantoday.com.pk/2012/02/20/at-war-with-this-thing-called-reality" target="_blank">Read more...</a></p>
<h2>Sana the X-ray artist</h2>
<p>February 13, 2012: How is it possible for someone to create art with X-rays? That’s probably the best reaction the artist Sana Horani has received on her work. “People tell me they’ve never even imagined that paintings could be created with X-rays,” she said to me in an interview. According to her, the importance of people understanding her art depends on the work, but she doesn’t care if people don’t like it. Her art fulfils her and gives her “a sense of satisfaction, the passion to do it again with something new, and a possibility to explore.” <a href="https://archive.pakistantoday.com.pk/2012/02/13/sana-the-x-ray-artist" target="_blank">Read more...</a></p>
<h2>Saqiba’s brush paints poetry</h2>
<p>February 13, 2012: A true artist has the skill of turning the ordinary into the extraordinary, Saqiba Suleman told me in an interview. Saqiba’s “extra sensitivity towards the various facets of life” makes her an artist. What really attracts her about her profession is the knowledge that she’s different, as well as her ability to portray what she feels. “Being an artist, I feel a sense of responsibility towards the society,” she said. <a href="https://archive.pakistantoday.com.pk/2012/02/13/saqiba%e2%80%99s-brush-paints-poetry" target="_blank">Read more...</a></p>
<h2>Creating art makes Munawar go OMG!</h2>
<p>February 13, 2012: Munawar Ali Syed feels like an artist the moment he engages himself in the visual arts, which soothes the “constant feeling of passion and restlessness” inside him. Syed told me in an interview that visual skills, sensitivity and madness make an artist. When asked how he feels about being an artist, he simply said, “Oh My God!” <a href="https://archive.pakistantoday.com.pk/2012/02/13/creating-art-makes-munawar-go-omg" target="_blank">Read more...</a></p>
<h2>‘Simplicity echoes reality’</h2>
<p>February 11, 2012: Monet-admiring Sara Aziz loves the feeling of being an artist. “I love it! I love being creative all the time!” she said to me in an interview. A lot of Sara’s work deals with the relationship between people and their environment, the overlapping of internal and external milieus. “I observe people and their behaviours in different sorts of environments. The environment, and our society, traditions and personal relationships are important. I keep myself open to inspiration from literally everything around me – from magazines to pets to fancy footwear.” <a href="https://archive.pakistantoday.com.pk/2012/02/11/%e2%80%98simplicity-echoes-reality%e2%80%99" target="_blank">Read more...</a></p>
<h2>Walking on fresh grass at dawn</h2>
<p>February 10, 2012: Art to the artist Natasha Iqbal is creation, dawn of a thought process. “It’s a vast genre. I believe art is present in everything: the art of talking, the art of cooking, the art of carrying yourself. And then, there are the visual arts, the performing arts and many other forms,” Natasha told me in an interview. According to her, an artist is someone who has the courage to express and propagate their thoughts and who knows that it is an artist who swims against the current. <a href="https://archive.pakistantoday.com.pk/2012/02/10/walkingon-fresh-grass-at-dawn" target="_blank">Read more...</a></p>
<h2>Clicking for heaven on Earth</h2>
<p>February 9, 2012: Heaven on Earth. It is this universal idea that inspires the photographer Malcolm Hutcheson. “Taking photographs is incredibly rewarding, and I feel very happy after a day’s work when I start to examine the negatives and see the compositions,” Hutcheson told me in an interview. However, he does not like the fact that few people get his photography. It feels like failure, he said, “but if everyone got it, it would be the worst kind of failure.” <a href="https://archive.pakistantoday.com.pk/2012/02/09/clicking-for-heaven-on-earth" target="_blank">Read more...</a></p>
<h2>‘Appearance, disappearance and reappearance’</h2>
<p>November 23, 2011: A conscious act that keeps the soul alive and provides a thought for new visions is art to Aqeel Solangi. For him, art is expression and experience – whether it is dance, literature, painting or singing. “Art is the mirror of a society and it is not removed from life. It is essential because without art, life is dull, colourless, thoughtless, visionless and senseless,” said Solangi in an interview with me. <a href="https://archive.pakistantoday.com.pk/2011/11/23/%e2%80%98appearance-disappearance-and-reappearance%e2%80%99" target="_blank">Read more...</a></p>
<h2>‘Papercuts’ rekindles joie de lire</h2>
<p>August 26, 2011: Marquise de Sévigné, a French noblewoman known mostly for her letters sent to her daughter, once wrote, “When I step into this library, I cannot understand why I ever step out of it.” That’s how I feel about Papercuts, a biannual e-zine (online magazine) published by the Desi Writers Lounge (DWL) at desiwriterslounge.net; when I enter the world of Papercuts and start reading wonderful prose and poetry by talented writers across the globe, I can’t understand why I ever stop. I talked with Papercuts’ Afia Aslam, Shehla Wynne, Waqas Naeem, Noorulain Noor and Osman Butt who fondly recounted to me their individual experiences with DWL. <a href="https://archive.pakistantoday.com.pk/2011/08/26/%e2%80%98papercuts%e2%80%99-rekindles-joie-de-lire" target="_blank">Read more...</a></p>
